/**
 * Regression test for the member-shadowing bug in SystemTicker.delay(): an
 * unqualified call to `delay(ms)` inside the overridden method resolves to
 * the same member and self-recurses until StackOverflowError. The bug is
 * production-only because the rest of the suite injects TestTicker, so
 * this file exists explicitly to exercise the real class with real time.
 *
 * Keep short delays here (single-digit ms) so the suite stays fast.
